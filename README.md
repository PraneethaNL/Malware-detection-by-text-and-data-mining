# Malware-detection-by-text-and-data-mining
Here, we employed text mining to extract features from the dataset consisting a series of API calls. Later mutual information is calculated for feature selection and machine learning technique is used to train our model.
 
 
 1.feature_extraction.py is file in which feature extraction is done by calculating tf* idf value for each API call.
 2.feature_selection.py is the in which feature selection is done by mutual_info_score.
 3.svm.py is the file in which svm is implemented and similarly tree.py
 the dataset for
